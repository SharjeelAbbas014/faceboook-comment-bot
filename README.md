# faceboook-comment-bot

The problem was that, there are certain groups on Facebook that gives the job to first 5 candidates who comment on their posts, created a bot with Python and Selenium that goes to those specified groups and checks for a new post every 15 seconds and comment on that post automatically, no inputs necessary what so ever.
